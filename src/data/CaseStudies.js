      '<p>Lexim suggested converting the website to the Magento platform and implementing a Netsuite ERP, a leading ERP SaaS application.</p>' +

      '<p>Additionally, Lexim implemented two payment gateways, one for the US and one for CA.\n' +
      '<p>Usually, it takes about six months to recover traffic and sales during a migration like this. However, in this case, there was only one month of a 7% decrease in traffic, and by the next month, traffic was back up. There was no impact on SEO, and after three months, e-commerce went up by 30%. Furthermore, Lexim fixed WCAG / ADA / CCPA compliance issues.</p>' +
      '<p>The business was ecstatic with the results. They were finally able to automate processes and take advantage of the new system\'s features. The migration had been a daunting task, but with Lexim\'s help, they were able to successfully transition to a new and improved system that allowed their business to grow and thrive.</p>'
